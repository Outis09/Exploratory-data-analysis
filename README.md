 The dataset used contains characteristics of patients and whether they showed up for their medical appointment or not. About 30% of patients missed their appointment
 after scheduling. I sought to examine the effect of individual independent variables on the dependent variable(whether a patient showed up or not). I explored the data 
 set and calculated the probabilities of a patient showing up given an independent variable. I also compared the effects of certain independent variables.
 
 The chracteristics of the patients I explored include;
 * gender of patient
 * age category of patient
 * day of the week of their appointment
 * if they were on a scholarship
 * if they were involved in alcoholism
 * if they were hypertensive
 * if they had diabetes 
 * if they were handicapped
 * if they received an sms
 
 The data also included:
 * patient id
 * appointment id
 * scheduling date
 * appointment date
 * neighbourhood
 * noshow column
